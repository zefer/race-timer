# zefochron

A countdown timer for model yacht race starts.

Implemented as a web-app for easy access, to allow it to be used on mobile
devices whilst playing music or other audio, and to allow the timer parameters
to be tweaked.

Uses the [Event Scheduler for Web Audio API](https://github.com/mohayonao/web-audio-scheduler)
